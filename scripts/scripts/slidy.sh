       --bash-completion
              Generate a bash completion script.  To enable bash completion with pandoc, add this to your .bashrc:

                     eval "$(pandoc --bash-completion)"

   Reader options
       --base-header-level=NUMBER
              Specify the base level for headers (defaults to 1).

       --toc, --table-of-contents
              Include an automatically generated table of contents (or, in the case of latex, context, docx, odt,  opendocument,
              rst,  or  ms,  an instruction to create one) in the output document.  This option has no effect unless -s/--stand‐
              alone is used, and it has no effect on man, docbook4, docbook5, or jats output.

       --toc-depth=NUMBER
              Specify the number of section levels to include in the table of contents.  The default  is  3  (which  means  that
              level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be listed in the contents).

       --highlight-style=STYLE|FILE
              Specifies  the  coloring  style  to be used in highlighted source code.  Options are pygments (the default), kate,
              monochrome, breezeDark, espresso, zenburn, haddock, and tango.  For more information  on  syntax  highlighting  in
              pandoc, see Syntax highlighting, below.  See also --list-highlight-styles.

              Instead  of  a STYLE name, a JSON file with extension .theme may be supplied.  This will be parsed as a KDE syntax
              highlighting theme and (if valid) used as the highlighting style.

              To generate the JSON version of an existing style, use --print-highlight-style.

       --ascii
              Use  only ASCII characters in output.  Currently supported for XML and HTML formats (which use entities instead of
              UTF-8 when this option is selected), CommonMark, gfm, and Markdown (which use entities), roff ms (which use  hexa‐
              decimal  escapes), and to a limited degree LaTeX (which uses standard commands for accented characters when possi‐
              ble).  roff man output uses ASCII by default.

       --reference-links
              Use reference-style links, rather than inline links, in writing Markdown or reStructuredText.  By  default  inline
              links are used.  The placement of link references is affected by the --reference-location option.

       --top-level-division=[default|section|chapter|part]
              Treat top-level headers as the given division type in LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, and TEI output.  The hierarchy  or‐
              der  is  part, chapter, then section; all headers are shifted such that the top-level header becomes the specified
              type.  The default behavior is to determine the best division type via heuristics: unless other conditions  apply,
              section  is chosen.  When the LaTeX document class is set to report, book, or memoir (unless the article option is
              specified), chapter is implied as the setting for this option.  If beamer is the output format, specifying  either
              chapter  or  part will cause top-level headers to become \part{..}, while second-level headers remain as their de‐
              fault type.

       -N, --number-sections
              Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, or EPUB output.  By default, sections are not numbered.  Sections
              with class unnumbered will never be numbered, even if --number-sections is specified.

       --number-offset=NUMBER[,NUMBER,...]
              Offset  for  section  headings in HTML output (ignored in other output formats).  The first number is added to the
              section number for top-level headers, the second for second-level headers, and so on.  So,  for  example,  if  you
              want  the first top-level header in your document to be numbered "6", specify --number-offset=5.  If your document
              starts with a level-2 header which you want to be numbered "1.5", specify --number-offset=1,4.  Offsets are  0  by
              default.  Implies --number-sections.

       -i, --incremental
              Make  list  items in slide shows display incrementally (one by one).  The default is for lists to be displayed all
              at once.

       --slide-level=NUMBER
              Specifies that headers with the specified level create slides (for beamer, s5, slidy, slideous, dzslides).   Head‐
              ers  above  this  level in the hierarchy are used to divide the slide show into sections; headers below this level
              create subheads within a slide.  Note that content that is not contained under slide-level headers will not appear
              in  the  slide show.  The default is to set the slide level based on the contents of the document; see Structuring
              the slide show.

       --section-divs
              Wrap sections in <section> tags (or <div> tags for html4), and attach identifiers to the enclosing  <section>  (or
              <div>) rather than the header itself.  See Header identifiers, below.

       --id-prefix=STRING
              Specify  a  prefix  to  be added to all identifiers and internal links in HTML and DocBook output, and to footnote
              numbers in Markdown and Haddock output.  This is useful for preventing duplicate identifiers when generating frag‐
              ments to be included in other pages.

       -T STRING, --title-prefix=STRING
              Specify  STRING as a prefix at the beginning of the title that appears in the HTML header (but not in the title as
              it appears at the beginning of the HTML body).  Implies --standalone.

       -c URL, --css=URL
              Link to a CSS style sheet.  This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files.  They will  be  included
              in the order specified.

              A  stylesheet  is  required  for generating EPUB.  If none is provided using this option (or the css or stylesheet
              metadata fields), pandoc will look for a file epub.css in the user data directory (see --data-dir).  If it is  not
              found there, sensible defaults will be used.

       --epub-cover-image=FILE
              Use the specified image as the EPUB cover.  It is recommended that the image be less  than  1000px  in  width  and
              height.   Note  that  in a Markdown source document you can also specify cover-image in a YAML metadata block (see
              EPUB Metadata, below).

       --epub-chapter-level=NUMBER
              Specify the header level at which to split the EPUB into separate "chapter" files.  The default is to  split  into
              chapters  at level 1 headers.  This option only affects the internal composition of the EPUB, not the way chapters
              and sections are displayed to users.  Some readers may be slow if the chapter files are too large,  so  for  large
              documents with few level 1 headers, one might want to use a chapter level of 2 or 3.

       --epub-subdirectory=DIRNAME
              Specify  the  subdirectory  in the OCF container that is to hold the EPUB-specific contents.  The default is EPUB.
              To put the EPUB contents in the top level, use an empty string.

   Math rendering in HTML
       The default is to render TeX math as far as possible using Unicode characters.  Formulas  are  put  inside  a  span  with
       class="math", so that they may be styled differently from the surrounding text if needed.  However, this gives acceptable
       results only for basic math, usually you will want to use --mathjax or another of the following options.

       --mathjax[=URL]
              Use MathJax to display embedded TeX math in HTML output.  TeX math will be put between \(...\) (for  inline  math)
              or \[...\] (for display math) and wrapped in <span> tags with class math.  Then the MathJax JavaScript will render
              it.  The URL should point to the MathJax.js load script.  If a URL is not provided, a link to the  Cloudflare  CDN
              will be inserted.

       --mathml
              Convert TeX math to MathML (in epub3, docbook4, docbook5, jats, html4 and html5).  This is the default in odt out‐
              put.  Note that currently only Firefox and Safari (and select e-book readers) natively support MathML.

       --webtex[=URL]
              Convert TeX formulas to <img> tags that link to an external script that converts formulas to images.  The  formula
              will  be  URL-encoded  and  concatenated  with  the URL provided.  For SVG images you can for example use --webtex
              https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?.  If no URL is specified, the CodeCogs URL  generating  PNGs  will  be  used
              (https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?).   Note:  the --webtex option will affect Markdown output as well as HTML,
              which is useful if you're targeting a version of Markdown without native math support.

       --katex[=URL]
              Use KaTeX to display embedded TeX math in HTML output.  The URL is the base URL for the KaTeX library.   That  di‐
              rectory should contain a katex.min.js and a katex.min.css file.  If a URL is not provided, a link to the KaTeX CDN
              will be inserted.

       --gladtex
              Enclose TeX math in <eq> tags in HTML output.  The resulting HTML can then be processed by GladTeX to produce  im‐
              ages of the typeset formulas and an HTML file with links to these images.  So, the procedure is:

                     pandoc -s --gladtex input.md -o myfile.htex
                     gladtex -d myfile-images myfile.htex
                     # produces myfile.html and images in myfile-images

   Options for wrapper scripts


   Language variables
       lang   identifies the main language of the document, using a code according to BCP 47 (e.g.  en or en-GB).  For some out‐
              put  formats, pandoc will convert it to an appropriate format stored in the additional variables babel-lang, poly‐
              glossia-lang (LaTeX) and context-lang (ConTeXt).

              Native pandoc Spans and Divs with the lang attribute (value in BCP 47) can be used to switch the language in  that
              range.   In  LaTeX  output,  babel-otherlangs and polyglossia-otherlangs variables will be generated automatically
              based on the lang attributes of Spans and Divs in the document.

       dir    the base direction of the document, either rtl (right-to-left) or ltr (left-to-right).

              For bidirectional documents, native pandoc spans and divs with the dir attribute (value rtl or ltr) can be used to
              override  the base direction in some output formats.  This may not always be necessary if the final renderer (e.g.
              the browser, when generating HTML) supports the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

              When using LaTeX for bidirectional documents, only the xelatex engine is fully supported  (use  --pdf-engine=xela‐
              tex).

       fontfamily
              font family (e.g.  T or P)

       indent paragraph indent (e.g.  2m)

   Using variables in templates
       Variable  names  are sequences of alphanumerics, -, and _, starting with a letter.  A variable name surrounded by $ signs
       will be replaced by its value.  For example, the string $title$ in

              <title>$title$</title>

       will be replaced by the document title.

       To write a literal $ in a template, use $$.

       Templates may contain conditionals.  The syntax is as follows:

              $if(variable)$
              X
              $else$
              Y
              $endif$

       This will include X in the template if variable has a truthy value; otherwise it will include Y.  Here a truthy value  is
       any of the following:

       • a string that is not entirely white space,

       • a non-empty array where the first value is truthy,

       • any number (including zero),

       • any object,

       • the  boolean  true  (to  specify  the boolean true value using YAML metadata or the --metadata flag, use true, True, or
         TRUE; with the --variable flag, simply omit a value for the variable, e.g.  --variable draft).

       X and Y are placeholders for any valid template text, and may include interpolated variables or other conditionals.   The
       $else$ section may be omitted.

       When variables can have multiple values (for example, author in a multi-author document), you can use the $for$ keyword:

              $for(author)$
              <meta name="author" content="$author$" />
              $endfor$

       You can optionally specify a separator to be used between consecutive items:

              $for(author)$$author$$sep$, $endfor$

       A dot can be used to select a field of a variable that takes an object as its value.  So, for example:

              $author.name$ ($author.affiliation$)

       If you use custom templates, you may need to revise them as pandoc changes.  We recommend tracking the changes in the de‐
       fault templates, and modifying your custom templates accordingly.  An easy way to do this is to fork the pandoc-templates
       repository and merge in changes after each pandoc release.

       Templates may contain comments: anything on a line after $-- will be treated as a comment and ignored.

EXTENSIONS
       The behavior of some of the readers and writers can be adjusted by enabling or disabling various extensions.

       An  extension  can  be  enabled  by adding +EXTENSION to the format name and disabled by adding -EXTENSION.  For example,
       --from markdown_strict+footnotes is strict Markdown with footnotes enabled, while  --from  markdown-footnotes-pipe_tables
       is pandoc's Markdown without footnotes or pipe tables.

       The  markdown  reader and writer make by far the most use of extensions.  Extensions only used by them are therefore cov‐
       ered in the section Pandoc's Markdown below (See Markdown variants for commonmark and gfm.) In the following,  extensions
       that also work for other formats are covered.

   Typography
   Extension: smart
       Interpret  straight  quotes  as curly quotes, --- as em-dashes, -- as en-dashes, and ... as ellipses.  Nonbreaking spaces
       are inserted after certain abbreviations, such as "Mr."

       This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

       input formats
              markdown, commonmark, latex, mediawiki, org, rst, twiki

       output formats
              markdown, latex, context, rst

       enabled by default in
              markdown, latex, context (both input and output)

       Note: If you are writing Markdown, then the smart extension has the reverse effect: what would  have  been  curly  quotes
       comes out straight.

       In  LaTeX,  smart  means  to use the standard TeX ligatures for quotation marks (`` and '' for double quotes, ` and ' for
       single quotes) and dashes (-- for en-dash and --- for em-dash).  If smart is disabled, then in reading LaTeX pandoc  will
       parse  these  characters literally.  In writing LaTeX, enabling smart tells pandoc to use the ligatures when possible; if
       smart is disabled pandoc will use unicode quotation mark and dash characters.

   Headers and sections
   Extension: auto_identifiers
       A header without an explicitly specified identifier will be automatically assigned  a  unique  identifier  based  on  the
       header text.

       This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

       input formats
              markdown, latex, rst, mediawiki, textile

       output formats
              markdown, muse

       enabled by default in
              markdown, muse

       The default algorithm used to derive the identifier from the header text is:

       • Remove all formatting, links, etc.

       • Remove all footnotes.

       • Remove all punctuation, except underscores, hyphens, and periods.

       • Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.

       • Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.

       • Remove everything up to the first letter (identifiers may not begin with a number or punctuation mark).

       • If nothing is left after this, use the identifier section.

       Thus, for example,

       Header                       Identifier
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Header identifiers in HTML   header-identifiers-in-html
       *Dogs*?--in *my* house?      dogs--in-my-house
       [HTML], [S5], or [RTF]?      html-s5-or-rtf
       3. Applications              applications
       33                           section

       These  rules  should,  in  most cases, allow one to determine the identifier from the header text.  The exception is when
       several headers have the same text; in this case, the first will get an identifier as described above;  the  second  will
       get the same identifier with -1 appended; the third with -2; and so on.

       (However, a different algorithm is used if gfm_auto_identifiers is enabled; see below.)

       These  identifiers  are  used to provide link targets in the table of contents generated by the --toc|--table-of-contents
       option.  They also make it easy to provide links from one section of a document to another.  A link to this section,  for
       example, might look like this:

              See the section on
              [header identifiers](#header-identifiers-in-html-latex-and-context).

       Note, however, that this method of providing links to sections works only in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt formats.

       If  the --section-divs option is specified, then each section will be wrapped in a section (or a div, if html4 was speci‐
       fied), and the identifier will be attached to the enclosing <section> (or <div>) tag rather than the header itself.  This
       allows entire sections to be manipulated using JavaScript or treated differently in CSS.

   Extension: ascii_identifiers
       Causes  the  identifiers  produced by auto_identifiers to be pure ASCII.  Accents are stripped off of accented Latin let‐
       ters, and non-Latin letters are omitted.

   Extension: gfm_auto_identifiers
       Changes the algorithm used by auto_identifiers to conform to GitHub's method.  Spaces are converted to dashes (-), upper‐
       case characters to lowercase characters, and punctuation characters other than - and _ are removed.

   Math Input
       The  extensions  tex_math_dollars,  tex_math_single_backslash, and tex_math_double_backslash are described in the section
       about Pandoc's Markdown.

       However, they can also be used with HTML input.  This is handy for reading web pages formatted using MathJax,  for  exam‐
       ple.

   Raw HTML/TeX
       The  following  extensions  (especially how they affect Markdown input/output) are also described in more detail in their
       respective sections of Pandoc's Markdown.

   Extension: raw_html
       When converting from HTML, parse elements to raw HTML which are not representable in pandoc's AST.  By default,  this  is
       disabled for HTML input.

   Extension: raw_tex
       Allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be included in a document.

       This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats (in addition to markdown):

       input formats
              latex, org, textile, html (environments, \ref, and \eqref only)

       output formats
              textile, commonmark

   Extension: native_divs
       This extension is enabled by default for HTML input.  This means that divs are parsed to pandoc native elements.  (Alter‐
       natively, you can parse them to raw HTML using -f html-native_divs+raw_html.)

       When converting HTML to Markdown, for example, you may want to drop all divs and spans:

              pandoc -f html-native_divs-native_spans -t markdown

   Extension: native_spans
       Analogous to native_divs above.

   Literate Haskell support
   Extension: literate_haskell
       Treat the document as literate Haskell source.

       This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

       input formats
              markdown, rst, latex

       output formats
              markdown, rst, latex, html

       If you append +lhs (or +literate_haskell) to one of the formats above, pandoc will treat the document as literate Haskell
       source.  This means that

       • In  Markdown  input,  "bird  track" sections will be parsed as Haskell code rather than block quotations.  Text between
         \begin{code} and \end{code} will also be treated as Haskell code.  For ATX-style headers the character '=' will be used
         instead of '#'.

       • In  Markdown output, code blocks with classes haskell and literate will be rendered using bird tracks, and block quota‐
         tions will be indented one space, so they will not be treated as Haskell code.  In addition, headers will  be  rendered
         setext-style (with underlines) rather than ATX-style (with '#' characters).  (This is because ghc treats '#' characters
         in column 1 as introducing line numbers.)

       • In restructured text input, "bird track" sections will be parsed as Haskell code.

       • In restructured text output, code blocks with class haskell will be rendered using bird tracks.

       • In LaTeX input, text in code environments will be parsed as Haskell code.

       • In LaTeX output, code blocks with class haskell will be rendered inside code environments.

       • In HTML output, code blocks with class haskell will be rendered with class literatehaskell and bird tracks.

       Examples:

              pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html

       reads literate Haskell source formatted with Markdown conventions and writes ordinary HTML (without bird tracks).

              pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html+lhs

       writes HTML with the Haskell code in bird tracks, so it can be copied and pasted as literate Haskell source.

       Note that GHC expects the bird tracks in the first column, so indented literate code blocks (e.g.  inside an itemized en‐
       vironment) will not be picked up by the Haskell compiler.

   Other extensions
   Extension: empty_paragraphs
       Allows empty paragraphs.  By default empty paragraphs are omitted.

       This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

       input formats
              docx, html

       output formats
              docx, odt, opendocument, html

   Extension: styles
       Read  all docx styles as divs (for paragraph styles) and spans (for character styles) regardless of whether pandoc under‐
       stands the meaning of these styles.  This can be used with docx custom styles.  Disabled by default.

       input formats
              docx

   Extension: amuse
       In the muse input format, this enables Text::Amuse extensions to Emacs Muse markup.

   Extension: citations
       Some aspects of Pandoc's Markdown citation syntax are also accepted in org input.

   Extension: ntb
       In the context output format this enables the use of Natural Tables (TABLE) instead of the default Extreme  Tables  (xta‐
       bles).  Natural tables allow more fine-grained global customization but come at a performance penalty compared to extreme
       tables.

PANDOC'S MARKDOWN
       Pandoc understands an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber's Markdown syntax.  This document explains the
       syntax,  noting differences from standard Markdown.  Except where noted, these differences can be suppressed by using the
       markdown_strict format instead of markdown.  Extensions can be enabled or disabled to specify the  behavior  more  granu‐
       larly.  They are described in the following.  See also Extensions above, for extensions that work also on other formats.

   Philosophy
       Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read:

              A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up
              with tags or formatting instructions.  -- John Gruber

       This principle has guided pandoc's decisions in finding syntax for tables, footnotes, and other extensions.

       There is, however, one respect in which pandoc's aims are different from the original aims of Markdown.  Whereas Markdown
       was originally designed with HTML generation in mind, pandoc is designed for multiple output formats.  Thus, while pandoc
       allows the embedding of raw HTML, it discourages it, and provides other, non-HTMLish ways of representing important docu‐
       ment elements like definition lists, tables, mathematics, and footnotes.

   Paragraphs
       A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank lines.  Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can
       reflow your paragraphs as you like.  If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line.

   Extension: escaped_line_breaks
       A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.  Note: in multiline and grid table cells, this is  the  only
       way to create a hard line break, since trailing spaces in the cells are ignored.

   Headers
       There are two kinds of headers: Setext and ATX.

   Setext-style headers
       A  setext-style  header  is  a line of text "underlined" with a row of = signs (for a level one header) or - signs (for a
       level two header):

              A level-one header
              ==================

              A level-two header
              ------------------

       The header text can contain inline formatting, such as emphasis (see Inline formatting, below).

   ATX-style headers
       An ATX-style header consists of one to six # signs and a line of text, optionally followed by any number of # signs.  The
       number of # signs at the beginning of the line is the header level:

              ## A level-two header

              ### A level-three header ###

       As with setext-style headers, the header text can contain formatting:

              # A level-one header with a [link](/url) and *emphasis*

   Extension: blank_before_header
       Standard  Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a header.  Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at
       the beginning of the document).  The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a # to end up at  the  be‐
       ginning of a line by accident (perhaps through line wrapping).  Consider, for example:

              I like several of their flavors of ice cream:
              #22, for example, and #5.

   Extension: space_in_atx_header
       Many Markdown implementations do not require a space between the opening #s of an ATX header and the header text, so that
       #5 bolt and #hashtag count as headers.  With this extension, pandoc does require the space.

   Header identifiers
       See also the auto_identifiers extension above.

   Extension: header_attributes
       Headers can be assigned attributes using this syntax at the end of the line containing the header text:

              {#identifier .class .class key=value key=value}

       Thus, for example, the following headers will all be assigned the identifier foo:

              # My header {#foo}

              ## My header ##    {#foo}

              My other header   {#foo}
              ---------------

       (This syntax is compatible with PHP Markdown Extra.)

       Note that although this syntax allows assignment of classes and key/value attributes, writers generally don't use all  of
       this  information.   Identifiers,  classes, and key/value attributes are used in HTML and HTML-based formats such as EPUB
       and slidy.  Identifiers are used for labels and link anchors in the LaTeX, ConTeXt, Textile, and AsciiDoc writers.

       Headers with the class unnumbered will not be numbered, even if --number-sections is specified.  A single hyphen  (-)  in
       an attribute context is equivalent to .unnumbered, and preferable in non-English documents.  So,

              # My header {-}

       is just the same as

              # My header {.unnumbered}

   Extension: implicit_header_references
       Pandoc behaves as if reference links have been defined for each header.  So, to link to a header

              # Header identifiers in HTML

       you can simply write

              [Header identifiers in HTML]

       or

              [Header identifiers in HTML][]

       or

              [the section on header identifiers][header identifiers in
              HTML]

       instead of giving the identifier explicitly:

              [Header identifiers in HTML](#header-identifiers-in-html)

       If  there  are multiple headers with identical text, the corresponding reference will link to the first one only, and you
       will need to use explicit links to link to the others, as described above.

       Like regular reference links, these references are case-insensitive.

       Explicit link reference definitions always take priority over implicit header references.  So, in the following  example,
       the link will point to bar, not to #foo:

              # Foo

              [foo]: bar

              See [foo]

   Block quotations
       Markdown  uses  email conventions for quoting blocks of text.  A block quotation is one or more paragraphs or other block
       elements (such as lists or headers), with each line preceded by a > character and an optional space.   (The  >  need  not
       start at the left margin, but it should not be indented more than three spaces.)

              > This is a block quote. This
              > paragraph has two lines.
              >
              > 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
              > 2. Second item.

       A "lazy" form, which requires the > character only on the first line of each block, is also allowed:

              > This is a block quote. This
              paragraph has two lines.

              > 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
              2. Second item.

       Among  the  block  elements  that can be contained in a block quote are other block quotes.  That is, block quotes can be
       nested:

              > This is a block quote.
              >
              > > A block quote within a block quote.

       If the > character is followed by an optional space, that space will be considered part of the block quote marker and not
       part  of the indentation of the contents.  Thus, to put an indented code block in a block quote, you need five spaces af‐
       ter the >:

              >     code

   Extension: blank_before_blockquote
       Standard Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a block  quote.   Pandoc  does  require  this  (except,  of
       course,  at  the beginning of the document).  The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a > to end up
       at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps through line wrapping).  So, unless the markdown_strict format  is  used,
       the following does not produce a nested block quote in pandoc:

              > This is a block quote.
              >> Nested.

   Verbatim (code) blocks
   Indented code blocks
       A block of text indented four spaces (or one tab) is treated as verbatim text: that is, special characters do not trigger
       special formatting, and all spaces and line breaks are preserved.  For example,

                  if (a > 3) {
                    moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
                  }

       The initial (four space or one tab) indentation is not considered part of the verbatim text, and is removed in  the  out‐
       put.

       Note: blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces.

   Fenced code blocks
   Extension: fenced_code_blocks
       In  addition  to  standard  indented code blocks, pandoc supports fenced code blocks.  These begin with a row of three or
       more tildes (~) and end with a row of tildes that must be at least as long as the starting row.  Everything between these
       lines is treated as code.  No indentation is necessary:

              ~~~~~~~
              if (a > 3) {
                moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
              }
              ~~~~~~~

       Like regular code blocks, fenced code blocks must be separated from surrounding text by blank lines.

       If  the  code itself contains a row of tildes or backticks, just use a longer row of tildes or backticks at the start and
       end:

              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              ~~~~~~~~~~
              code including tildes
              ~~~~~~~~~~
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Extension: backtick_code_blocks
       Same as fenced_code_blocks, but uses backticks (`) instead of tildes (~).

   Extension: fenced_code_attributes
       Optionally, you may attach attributes to fenced or backtick code block using this syntax:

              ~~~~ {#mycode .haskell .numberLines startFrom="100"}
              qsort []     = []
              qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++
                             qsort (filter (>= x) xs)
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Here mycode is an identifier, haskell and numberLines are classes, and startFrom is an attribute with  value  100.   Some
       output formats can use this information to do syntax highlighting.  Currently, the only output formats that uses this in‐
       formation are HTML, LaTeX, Docx, Ms, and PowerPoint.  If highlighting is supported for your output format  and  language,
       then the code block above will appear highlighted, with numbered lines.  (To see which languages are supported, type pan‐
       doc --list-highlight-languages.) Otherwise, the code block above will appear as follows:

              <pre id="mycode" class="haskell numberLines" startFrom="100">
                <code>
                ...
                </code>
              </pre>

       The numberLines (or number-lines) class will cause the lines of the code block to be numbered, starting  with  1  or  the
       value  of  the startFrom attribute.  The lineAnchors (or line-anchors) class will cause the lines to be clickable anchors
       in HTML output.

       A shortcut form can also be used for specifying the language of the code block:

              ```haskell
              qsort [] = []
              ```

       This is equivalent to:

              ``` {.haskell}
              qsort [] = []
              ```

       If the fenced_code_attributes extension is disabled, but input contains class attribute(s) for the code block, the  first
       class attribute will be printed after the opening fence as a bare word.

       To  prevent  all  highlighting,  use the --no-highlight flag.  To set the highlighting style, use --highlight-style.  For
       more information on highlighting, see Syntax highlighting, below.

   Line blocks
   Extension: line_blocks
       A line block is a sequence of lines beginning with a vertical bar (|) followed by a space.  The division into lines  will
       be preserved in the output, as will any leading spaces; otherwise, the lines will be formatted as Markdown.  This is use‐
       ful for verse and addresses:

       The lines can be hard-wrapped if needed, but the continuation line must begin with a space.

       This syntax is borrowed from reStructuredText.

   Lists
   Bullet lists
       A bullet list is a list of bulleted list items.  A bulleted list item begins with a bullet (*, +, or -).  Here is a  sim‐
       ple example:

              * one
              * two
              * three

       This will produce a "compact" list.  If you want a "loose" list, in which each item is formatted as a paragraph, put spa‐
       ces between the items:

              * one

              * two

              * three

       The bullets need not be flush with the left margin; they may be indented one, two, or three spaces.  The bullet  must  be
       followed by whitespace.

       List items look best if subsequent lines are flush with the first line (after the bullet):

              * here is my first
                list item.
              * and my second.

       But Markdown also allows a "lazy" format:

              * here is my first
              list item.
              * and my second.

   Block content in list items
       A  list  item may contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level content.  However, subsequent paragraphs must be pre‐
       ceded by a blank line and indented to line up with the first non-space content after the list marker.

                * First paragraph.

                  Continued.

                * Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented
                  eight spaces:

                      { code }

       Exception: if the list marker is followed by an indented code block, which must begin 5 spaces  after  the  list  marker,
       then subsequent paragraphs must begin two columns after the last character of the list marker:

              *     code

                continuation paragraph

       List items may include other lists.  In this case the preceding blank line is optional.  The nested list must be indented
       to line up with the first non-space character after the list marker of the containing list item.

              * fruits
                + apples
                  - macintosh
                  - red delicious
                + pears
                + peaches
              * vegetables
                + broccoli
                + chard

       As noted above, Markdown allows you to write list items "lazily," instead of indenting continuation lines.   However,  if
       there are multiple paragraphs or other blocks in a list item, the first line of each must be indented.

              + A lazy, lazy, list
              item.

              + Another one; this looks
              bad but is legal.

                  Second paragraph of second
              list item.

   Ordered lists
       Ordered lists work just like bulleted lists, except that the items begin with enumerators rather than bullets.

       In  standard  Markdown, enumerators are decimal numbers followed by a period and a space.  The numbers themselves are ig‐
       nored, so there is no difference between this list:

              1.  one
              2.  two
              3.  three

       and this one:

              5.  one
              7.  two
              1.  three

   Extension: fancy_lists
       Unlike standard Markdown, pandoc allows ordered list items to be marked with uppercase and lowercase  letters  and  roman
       numerals,  in  addition  to  Arabic  numerals.   List  markers  may  be  enclosed  in parentheses or followed by a single
       right-parentheses or period.  They must be separated from the text that follows by at least one space, and, if  the  list
       marker is a capital letter with a period, by at least two spaces.

       The fancy_lists extension also allows '#' to be used as an ordered list marker in place of a numeral:

              #. one
              #. two

   Extension: startnum
       Pandoc  also  pays attention to the type of list marker used, and to the starting number, and both of these are preserved
       where possible in the output format.  Thus, the following yields a list with numbers followed by  a  single  parenthesis,
       starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase roman numerals:

               9)  Ninth
              10)  Tenth
              11)  Eleventh
                     i. subone
                    ii. subtwo
                   iii. subthree

       Pandoc  will  start  a  new  list each time a different type of list marker is used.  So, the following will create three
       lists:

              (2) Two
              (5) Three
              1.  Four
              *   Five

       If default list markers are desired, use #.:

              #.  one
              #.  two
              #.  three

   Definition lists
   Extension: definition_lists
       Pandoc supports definition lists, using the syntax of PHP Markdown Extra with some extensions.

              Term 1

              :   Definition 1

              Term 2 with *inline markup*

              :   Definition 2

                      { some code, part of Definition 2 }

                  Third paragraph of definition 2.

       Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally be followed by a blank line, and must be followed  by  one  or  more
       definitions.  A definition begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one or two spaces.

       A  term  may  have  multiple  definitions, and each definition may consist of one or more block elements (paragraph, code
       block, list, etc.), each indented four spaces or one tab stop.  The body of the definition  (including  the  first  line,
       aside  from  the colon or tilde) should be indented four spaces.  However, as with other Markdown lists, you can "lazily"
       omit indentation except at the beginning of a paragraph or other block element:

              Term 1

              :   Definition
              with lazy continuation.

                  Second paragraph of the definition.

       If you leave space before the definition (as in the example above), the text of the definition will be treated as a para‐
       graph.  In some output formats, this will mean greater spacing between term/definition pairs.  For a more compact defini‐
       tion list, omit the space before the definition:

              Term 1
                ~ Definition 1

              Term 2
                ~ Definition 2a
                ~ Definition 2b

       Note that space between items in a definition list is required.  (A variant that loosens this requirement, but  disallows
       "lazy" hard wrapping, can be activated with compact_definition_lists: see Non-pandoc extensions, below.)

   Numbered example lists
   Extension: example_lists
       The  special  list  marker @ can be used for sequentially numbered examples.  The first list item with a @ marker will be
       numbered '1', the next '2', and so on, throughout the document.  The numbered examples need not occur in a  single  list;
       each new list using @ will take up where the last stopped.  So, for example:

              (@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
              (@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

              Explanation of examples.

              (@)  My third example will be numbered (3).

       Numbered examples can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the document:

              (@good)  This is a good example.

              As (@good) illustrates, ...

       The label can be any string of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or hyphens.

       Note:  continuation paragraphs in example lists must always be indented four spaces, regardless of the length of the list
       marker.  That is, example lists always behave as if the four_space_rule extension is set.  This is because example labels
       tend to be long, and indenting content to the first non-space character after the label would be awkward.

   Compact and loose lists
       Pandoc behaves differently from Markdown.pl on some "edge cases" involving lists.  Consider this source:

              +   First
              +   Second:
                  -   Fee
                  -   Fie
                  -   Foe

              +   Third

       Pandoc transforms this into a "compact list" (with no <p> tags around "First", "Second", or "Third"), while Markdown puts
       <p> tags around "Second" and "Third" (but not "First"), because of the blank space around "Third".  Pandoc follows a sim‐
       ple  rule:  if the text is followed by a blank line, it is treated as a paragraph.  Since "Second" is followed by a list,
       and not a blank line, it isn't treated as a paragraph.  The fact that the list is followed by a blank line is irrelevant.
       (Note: Pandoc works this way even when the markdown_strict format is specified.  This behavior is consistent with the of‐
       ficial Markdown syntax description, even though it is different from that of Markdown.pl.)

   Ending a list
       What if you want to put an indented code block after a list?

              -   item one
              -   item two

                  { my code block }

       Trouble! Here pandoc (like other Markdown implementations) will treat { my code block } as the second paragraph  of  item
       two, and not as a code block.

       To "cut off" the list after item two, you can insert some non-indented content, like an HTML comment, which won't produce
       visible output in any format:

              -   item one
              -   item two

              <!-- end of list -->

                  { my code block }

       You can use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead of one big list:

              1.  one
              2.  two
              3.  three

              <!-- -->

              1.  uno
              2.  dos
              3.  tres

   Horizontal rules
       A line containing a row of three or more *, -, or _ characters (optionally separated by  spaces)  produces  a  horizontal
       rule:

              *  *  *  *

              ---------------

   Tables
       Four  kinds of tables may be used.  The first three kinds presuppose the use of a fixed-width font, such as Courier.  The
       fourth kind can be used with proportionally spaced fonts, as it does not require lining up columns.

   Extension: table_captions
       A caption may optionally be provided with all 4 kinds of tables (as illustrated in the examples below).  A caption  is  a
       paragraph beginning with the string Table: (or just :), which will be stripped off.  It may appear either before or after
       the table.

   Extension: simple_tables
       Simple tables look like this:

                Right     Left     Center     Default
              -------     ------ ----------   -------
                   12     12        12            12
                  123     123       123          123
                    1     1          1             1

              Table:  Demonstration of simple table syntax.

       The headers and table rows must each fit on one line.  Column alignments are determined by the  position  of  the  header
       text relative to the dashed line below it:

       • If  the  dashed  line        is flush with the header text on the right side but extends beyond it on the left, the column is
         right-aligned.

       • If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the left side but extends beyond it on the  right,  the  column  is
         left-aligned.

       • If the dashed line extends beyond the header text on both sides, the column is centered.

       • If the dashed line is flush with the header text on both sides, the default alignment is used (in most cases, this will
         be left).

       The table must end with a blank line, or a line of dashes followed by a blank line.

       The column headers may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used to end the table.  For example:

              -------     ------ ----------   -------
                   12     12        12             12
                  123     123       123           123
                    1     1          1              1
              -------     ------ ----------   -------

       When headers are omitted, column alignments are determined on the basis of the first line of the table body.  So, in  the
       tables above, the columns would be right, left, center, and right aligned, respectively.

   Extension: multiline_tables
       Multiline  tables  allow  headers  and table rows to span multiple lines of text (but cells that span multiple columns or
       rows of the table are not supported).  Here is an example:

              -------------------------------------------------------------
               Centered   Default           Right Left
                Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
              ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
                 First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                                  spans multiple lines.

                Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                                  the blank line between
                                                  rows.
              -------------------------------------------------------------

              Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
              multiple lines.

       These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:

       • They must begin with a row of dashes, before the header text (unless the headers are omitted).

       • They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.

       • The rows must be separated by blank lines.

       In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of the columns, and the writers try to reproduce these
       relative  widths  in the output.  So, if you find that one of the columns is too narrow in the output, try widening it in
       the Markdown source.

       Headers may be omitted in multiline tables as well as simple tables:

              ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
                 First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                                  spans multiple lines.

                Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                                  the blank line between
                                                  rows.
              ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------

              : Here's a multiline table without headers.

       It is possible for a multiline table to have just one row, but the row should be followed by a blank line (and  then  the
       row of dashes that ends the table), or the table may be interpreted as a simple table.

   Extension: grid_tables
       Grid tables look like this:

              : Sample grid table.

              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
              | Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
              +===============+===============+====================+
              | Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
              |               |               | - bright color     |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
              | Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
              |               |               | - tasty            |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

       The row of =s separates the header from the table body, and can be omitted for a headerless table.  The cells of grid ta‐
       bles may contain arbitrary block elements (multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists, etc.).  Cells that span multiple col‐
       umns or rows are not supported.  Grid tables can be created easily using Emacs table mode.

       Alignments  can  be  specified  as  with pipe tables, by putting colons at the boundaries of the separator line after the
       header:

              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
              | Right         | Left          | Centered           |
              +==============:+:==============+:==================:+
              | Bananas       | $1.34         | built-in wrapper   |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

       For headerless tables, the colons go on the top line instead:

              +--------------:+:--------------+:------------------:+
              | Right         | Left          | Centered           |
              +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

   Grid Table Limitations
       Pandoc does not support grid tables with row spans or column spans.  This means that neither variable numbers of  columns
       across rows nor variable numbers of rows across columns are supported by Pandoc.  All grid tables must have the same num‐
       ber of columns in each row, and the same number of rows in each column.  For example, the  Docutils  sample  grid  tables
       will not render as expected with Pandoc.

   Extension: pipe_tables
       Pipe tables look like this:

              | Right | Left | Default | Center |
              |------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
              |   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
              |  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
              |    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

                : Demonstration of pipe table syntax.

       The  syntax  is identical to PHP Markdown Extra tables.  The beginning and ending pipe characters are optional, but pipes
       are required between all columns.  The colons indicate column alignment as shown.  The header cannot be omitted.  To sim‐
       ulate a headerless table, include a header with blank cells.

       Since  the  pipes  indicate  column boundaries, columns need not be vertically aligned, as they are in the above example.
       So, this is a perfectly legal (though ugly) pipe table:

              fruit| price
              -----|-----:
              apple|2.05
              pear|1.37
              orange|3.09

       The cells of pipe tables cannot contain block elements like paragraphs and lists, and cannot span multiple lines.   If  a
       pipe  table  contains  a  row whose printable content is wider than the column width (see --columns), then the table will
       take up the full text width and the cell contents will wrap, with the relative cell widths determined by  the  number  of
       dashes  in  the line separating the table header from the table body.  (For example ---|- would make the first column 3/4
       and the second column 1/4 of the full text width.) On the other hand, if no lines are wider than column width, then  cell
       contents will not be wrapped, and the cells will be sized to their contents.

       Note: pandoc also recognizes pipe tables of the following form, as can be produced by Emacs' orgtbl-mode:

              | One | Two   |
              |-----+-------|
              | my  | table |
              | is  | nice  |

       The  difference  is that + is used instead of |.  Other orgtbl features are not supported.  In particular, to get non-de‐
       fault column alignment, you'll need to add colons as above.

   Metadata blocks
   Extension: pandoc_title_block
       If the file begins with a title block

              % title
              % author(s) (separated by semicolons)
              % date

       it will be parsed as bibliographic information, not regular text.  (It will be used, for example, in the title of  stand‐
       alone  LaTeX  or  HTML output.) The block may contain just a title, a title and an author, or all three elements.  If you
       want to include an author but no title, or a title and a date but no author, you need a blank line:

              %
              % Author

              % My title
              %
              % June 15, 2006

       The title may occupy multiple lines, but continuation lines must begin with leading space, thus:

              % My title
                on multiple lines

       If a document has multiple authors, the authors may be put on separate lines with leading space, or  separated  by  semi‐
       colons, or both.  So, all of the following are equivalent:

              % Author One
                Author Two

              % Author One; Author Two

              % Author One;
                Author Two

       The date must fit on one line.

       All three metadata fields may contain standard inline formatting (italics, links, footnotes, etc.).

       Title blocks will always be parsed, but they will affect the output only when the --standalone (-s) option is chosen.  In
       HTML output, titles will appear twice: once in the document head -- this is the title that will appear at the top of  the
       window  in  a  browser -- and once at the beginning of the document body.  The title in the document head can have an op‐
       tional prefix attached (--title-prefix or -T option).  The title in the body appears as an H1 element with class "title",
       so  it  can  be suppressed or reformatted with CSS.  If a title prefix is specified with -T and no title block appears in
       the document, the title prefix will be used by itself as the HTML title.

       The man page writer extracts a title, man page section number, and other header and footer  information  from  the  title
       line.   The  title is assumed to be the first word on the title line, which may optionally end with a (single-digit) sec‐
       tion number in parentheses.  (There should be no space between the title and the parentheses.)  Anything  after  this  is
       assumed  to be additional footer and header text.  A single pipe character (|) should be used to separate the footer text
       from the header text.  Thus,

              % PANDOC(1)

       will yield a man page with the title PANDOC and section 1.

              % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals

       will also have "Pandoc User Manuals" in the footer.

              % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals | Version 4.0

       will also have "Version 4.0" in the header.

   Extension: yaml_metadata_block
       A YAML metadata block is a valid YAML object, delimited by a line of three hyphens (---) at the top and a line  of  three
       hyphens  (---) or three dots (...) at the bottom.  A YAML metadata block may occur anywhere in the document, but if it is
       not at the beginning, it must be preceded by a blank line.  (Note that, because of  the  way  pandoc  concatenates  input
       files when several are provided, you may also keep the metadata in a separate YAML file and pass it to pandoc as an argu‐
       ment, along with your Markdown files:

              pandoc chap1.md chap2.md chap3.md metadata.yaml -s -o book.html

       Just be sure that the YAML file begins with --- and ends with --- or ....) Alternatively, you can use the --metadata-file
       option.   Using  that  approach however, you cannot reference content (like footnotes) from the main markdown input docu‐
       ment.

       Metadata will be taken from the fields of the YAML object and added to any existing document metadata.  Metadata can con‐
       tain  lists  and objects (nested arbitrarily), but all string scalars will be interpreted as Markdown.  Fields with names
       ending in an underscore will be ignored by pandoc.  (They may be given a role by external processors.) Field  names  must
       not  be  interpretable  as  YAML  numbers  or  boolean values (so, for example, yes, True, and 15 cannot be used as field
       names).

       A document may contain multiple metadata blocks.  The metadata fields will be combined through a  left-biased  union:  if
       two metadata blocks attempt to set the same field, the value from the first block will be taken.

       When  pandoc  is  used with -t markdown to create a Markdown document, a YAML metadata block will be produced only if the
       -s/--standalone option is used.  All of the metadata will appear in a single block at the beginning of the document.

       Note that YAML escaping rules must be followed.  Thus, for example, if a title contains a colon, it must be quoted.   The
       pipe  character (|) can be used to begin an indented block that will be interpreted literally, without need for escaping.
       This form is necessary when the field contains blank lines or block-level formatting:

              ---
              title:  'This is the title: it contains a colon'
              author:
              - Author One
              - Author Two
              keywords: [nothing, nothingness]
              abstract: |
                This is the abstract.

                It consists of two paragraphs.
              ...

       Template variables will be set automatically from the metadata.  Thus, for example, in writing  HTML,  the  variable  ab‐
       stract will be set to the HTML equivalent of the Markdown in the abstract field:

              <p>This is the abstract.</p>
              <p>It consists of two paragraphs.</p>

       Variables  can contain arbitrary YAML structures, but the template must match this structure.  The author variable in the
       default templates expects a simple list or string, but can be changed to support more complicated structures.   The  fol‐
       lowing combination, for example, would add an affiliation to the author if one is given:

              ---
              title: The document title
              author:
              - name: Author One
                affiliation: University of Somewhere
              - name: Author Two
                affiliation: University of Nowhere
              ...

       To use the structured authors in the example above, you would need a custom template:

              $for(author)$
              $if(author.name)$
              $author.name$$if(author.affiliation)$ ($author.affiliation$)$endif$
              $else$
              $author$
              $endif$
              $endfor$

       Raw  content to include in the document's header may be specified using header-includes; however, it is important to mark
       up this content as raw code for a particular output format, using the raw_attribute extension), or it will be interpreted
       as markdown.  For example:

              header-includes:
              - |
                ```{=latex}
                \let\oldsection\section
                \renewcommand{\section}[1]{\clearpage\oldsection{#1}}
                ```

   Backslash escapes
   Extension: all_symbols_escapable
       Except  inside  a  code  block or inline code, any punctuation or space character preceded by a backslash will be treated
       literally, even if it would normally indicate formatting.  Thus, for example, if one writes

              *\*hello\**

       one will get

              <em>*hello*</em>

       instead of

              <strong>hello</strong>

       This rule is easier to remember than standard Markdown's rule, which allows only the following  characters  to  be  back‐
       slash-escaped:

              \`*_{}[]()>#+-.!

       (However, if the markdown_strict format is used, the standard Markdown rule will be used.)

       A  backslash-escaped  space  is  parsed as a nonbreaking space.  It will appear in TeX output as ~ and in HTML and XML as
       \&#160; or \&nbsp;.

       A backslash-escaped newline (i.e.  a backslash occurring at the end of a line) is parsed as a hard line break.   It  will
       appear in TeX output as \\ and in HTML as <br />.  This is a nice alternative to Markdown's "invisible" way of indicating
       hard line breaks using two trailing spaces on a line.

       Backslash escapes do not work in verbatim contexts.

   Inline formatting
   Emphasis
       To emphasize some text, surround it with *s or _, like this:

              This text is _emphasized with underscores_, and this
              is *emphasized with asterisks*.

       Double * or _ produces strong emphasis:

              This is **strong emphasis** and __with underscores__.

       A * or _ character surrounded by spaces, or backslash-escaped, will not trigger emphasis:

              This is * not emphasized *, and \*neither is this\*.

   Extension: intraword_underscores
       Because _ is sometimes used inside words and identifiers, pandoc does not interpret a _ surrounded by alphanumeric  char‐
       acters as an emphasis marker.  If you want to emphasize just part of a word, use *:

              feas*ible*, not feas*able*.

   Strikeout
   Extension: strikeout
       To strikeout a section of text with a horizontal line, begin and end it with ~~.  Thus, for example,

              This ~~is deleted text.~~

   Superscripts and subscripts
   Extension: superscript, subscript
       Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by ^ characters; subscripts may be written by surround‐
       ing the subscripted text by ~ characters.  Thus, for example,

              H~2~O is a liquid.  2^10^ is 1024.

       If the superscripted or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces must be escaped with  backslashes.   (This  is  to
       prevent  accidental  superscripting and subscripting through the ordinary use of ~ and ^.) Thus, if you want the letter P
       with 'a cat' in subscripts, use P~a\ cat~, not P~a cat~.

   Verbatim
       To make a short span of text verbatim, put it inside backticks:

              What is the difference between `>>=` and `>>`?

       If the verbatim text includes a backtick, use double backticks:

              Here is a literal backtick `` ` ``.

       (The spaces after the opening backticks and before the closing backticks will be ignored.)

       The general rule is that a verbatim span starts with a string of consecutive backticks (optionally followed by  a  space)
       and ends with a string of the same number of backticks (optionally preceded by a space).

       Note that backslash-escapes (and other Markdown constructs) do not work in verbatim contexts:

              This is a backslash followed by an asterisk: `\*`.

   Extension: inline_code_attributes
       Attributes can be attached to verbatim text, just as with fenced code blocks:

              `<$>`{.haskell}

   Small caps
       To write small caps, use the smallcaps class:

              [Small caps]{.smallcaps}

       Or, without the bracketed_spans extension:

              <span class="smallcaps">Small caps</span>

       For compatibility with other Markdown flavors, CSS is also supported:

              <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small caps</span>

       This will work in all output formats that support small caps.

   Math
   Extension: tex_math_dollars
       Anything between two $ characters will be treated as TeX math.  The opening $ must have a non-space character immediately
       to its right, while the closing $ must have a non-space character immediately to its left, and must not be followed imme‐
       diately  by a digit.  Thus, $20,000 and $30,000 won't parse as math.  If for some reason you need to enclose text in lit‐
       eral $ characters, backslash-escape them and they won't be treated as math delimiters.

       TeX math will be printed in all output formats.  How it is rendered depends on the output format:

       LaTeX  It will appear verbatim surrounded by \(...\) (for inline math) or \[...\] (for display math).

       Markdown, Emacs Org mode, ConTeXt, ZimWiki
              It will appear verbatim surrounded by $...$ (for inline math) or $$...$$ (for display math).

       reStructuredText
              It will be rendered using an interpreted text role :math:.

       AsciiDoc
              It will be rendered as latexmath:[...].

       Texinfo
              It will be rendered inside a @math command.

       roff man
              It will be rendered verbatim without $'s.

       MediaWiki, DokuWiki
              It will be rendered inside <math> tags.

       Textile
              It will be rendered inside <span class="math"> tags.

       RTF, OpenDocument
              It will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters, and will otherwise appear verbatim.

       ODT    It will be rendered, if possible, using MathML.

       DocBook
              If the --mathml flag is used, it will be rendered using MathML in an inlineequation or informalequation tag.  Oth‐
              erwise it will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters.

       Docx   It will be rendered using OMML math markup.

       FictionBook2
              If  the  --webtex  option is used, formulas are rendered as images using CodeCogs or other compatible web service,
              downloaded and embedded in the e-book.  Otherwise, they will appear verbatim.

       HTML, Slidy, DZSlides, S5, EPUB
              The way math is rendered in HTML will depend on the command-line options selected.  Therefore see  Math  rendering
              in HTML above.

   Raw HTML
   Extension: raw_html
       Markdown  allows  you to insert raw HTML (or DocBook) anywhere in a document (except verbatim contexts, where <, >, and &
       are interpreted literally).  (Technically this is not an extension, since standard Markdown allows it, but  it  has  been
       made an extension so that it can be disabled if desired.)

       The  raw  HTML  is passed through unchanged in HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown, CommonMark, Emacs Org
       mode, and Textile output, and suppressed in other formats.

       In the CommonMark format, if raw_html is enabled, superscripts, subscripts, strikeouts and small capitals will be  repre‐
       sented  as  HTML.   Otherwise, plain-text fallbacks will be used.  Note that even if raw_html is disabled, tables will be
       rendered with HTML syntax if they cannot use pipe syntax.

   Extension: markdown_in_html_blocks
       Standard Markdown allows you to include HTML "blocks": blocks of HTML between balanced tags that are separated  from  the
       surrounding  text with blank lines, and start and end at the left margin.  Within these blocks, everything is interpreted
       as HTML, not Markdown; so (for example), * does not signify emphasis.

       Pandoc behaves this way when the markdown_strict format is used; but by default, pandoc interprets material between  HTML
       block tags as Markdown.  Thus, for example, pandoc will turn

              <table>
              <tr>
              <td>*one*</td>
              <td>[a link](http://google.com)</td>
              </tr>
              </table>

       into

              <table>
              <tr>
              <td><em>one</em></td>
              <td><a href="http://google.com">a link</a></td>
              </tr>
              </table>

       whereas Markdown.pl will preserve it as is.

       There is one exception to this rule: text between <script> and <style> tags is not interpreted as Markdown.

       This  departure  from standard Markdown should make it easier to mix Markdown with HTML block elements.  For example, one
       can surround a block of Markdown text with <div> tags without preventing it from being interpreted as Markdown.

   Extension: native_divs
       Use native pandoc Div blocks for content inside <div> tags.  For the most part this should give the same output as  mark‐
       down_in_html_blocks, but it makes it easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups of blocks.

   Extension: native_spans
       Use  native  pandoc  Span  blocks  for content inside <span> tags.  For the most part this should give the same output as
       raw_html, but it makes it easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups of inlines.

   Extension: raw_tex
       In addition to raw HTML, pandoc allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be included in a  document.   Inline  TeX  commands
       will be preserved and passed unchanged to the LaTeX and ConTeXt writers.  Thus, for example, you can use LaTeX to include
       BibTeX citations:

              This result was proved in \cite{jones.1967}.

       Note that in LaTeX environments, like

              \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
              Age & Frequency \\ \hline
              18--25  & 15 \\
              26--35  & 33 \\
              36--45  & 22 \\ \hline
              \end{tabular}

       the material between the begin and end tags will be interpreted as raw LaTeX, not as Markdown.

       Inline LaTeX is ignored in output formats other than Markdown, LaTeX, Emacs Org mode, and ConTeXt.

   Generic raw attribute
   Extension: raw_attribute
       Inline spans and fenced code blocks with a special kind of attribute will be parsed as raw content  with  the  designated
       format.  For example, the following produces a raw roff ms block:

              ```{=ms}
              .MYMACRO
              blah blah
              ```

       And the following produces a raw html inline element:

              This is `<a>html</a>`{=html}

       This can be useful to insert raw xml into docx documents, e.g.  a pagebreak:

              ```{=openxml}
              <w:p>
                <w:r>
                  <w:br w:type="page"/>
                </w:r>
              </w:p>
              ```

       The  format  name  should  match the target format name (see -t/--to, above, for a list, or use pandoc --list-output-for‐
       mats).  Use openxml for docx output, opendocument for odt output, html5 for epub3 output, html4 for epub2 output, and la‐
       tex, beamer, ms, or html5 for pdf output (depending on what you use for --pdf-engine).

       This  extension presupposes that the relevant kind of inline code or fenced code block is enabled.  Thus, for example, to
       use a raw attribute with a backtick code block, backtick_code_blocks must be enabled.

       The raw attribute cannot be combined with regular attributes.

   LaTeX macros
   Extension: latex_macros
       When this extension is enabled, pandoc will parse LaTeX macro definitions and apply the resulting  macros  to  all  LaTeX
       math and raw LaTeX.  So, for example, the following will work in all output formats, not just LaTeX:

              \newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}

              $\tuple{a, b, c}$

       Note  that LaTeX macros will not be applied if they occur inside inside a raw span or block marked with the raw_attribute
       extension.

       When latex_macros is disabled, the raw LaTeX and math will not have macros applied.  This is usually  a  better  approach
       when you are targeting LaTeX or PDF.

       Whether or not latex_macros is enabled, the macro definitions will still be passed through as raw LaTeX.

   Links
       Markdown allows links to be specified in several ways.

   Automatic links
       If you enclose a URL or email address in pointy brackets, it will become a link:

              <http://google.com>
              <sam@green.eggs.ham>

   Inline links
       An  inline  link  consists of the link text in square brackets, followed by the URL in parentheses.  (Optionally, the URL
       can be followed by a link title, in quotes.)

              This is an [inline link](/url), and here's [one with
              a title](http://fsf.org "click here for a good time!").

       There can be no space between the bracketed part and the parenthesized part.  The link text can contain formatting  (such
       as emphasis), but the title cannot.

       Email addresses in inline links are not autodetected, so they have to be prefixed with mailto:

              [Write me!](mailto:sam@green.eggs.ham)

   Reference links
       An explicit reference link has two parts, the link itself and the link definition, which may occur elsewhere in the docu‐
       ment (either before or after the link).

       The link consists of link text in square brackets, followed by a label in square brackets.  (There cannot  be  space  be‐
       tween  the two unless the spaced_reference_links extension is enabled.) The link definition consists of the bracketed la‐
       bel, followed by a colon and a space, followed by the URL, and optionally (after a space) a link title either  in  quotes
       or  in  parentheses.   The label must not be parseable as a citation (assuming the citations extension is enabled): cita‐
       tions take precedence over link labels.

       Here are some examples:

              [my label 1]: /foo/bar.html  "My title, optional"
              [my label 2]: /foo
              [my label 3]: http://fsf.org (The free software foundation)
              [my label 4]: /bar#special  'A title in single quotes'

       The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:

              [my label 5]: <http://foo.bar.baz>

       The title may go on the next line:

              [my label 3]: http://fsf.org
                "The free software foundation"

       Note that link labels are not case sensitive.  So, this will work:

              Here is [my link][FOO]

              [Foo]: /bar/baz

       In an implicit reference link, the second pair of brackets is empty:

              See [my website][].

              [my website]: http://foo.bar.baz

       Note: In Markdown.pl and most other Markdown implementations, reference link definitions cannot occur in nested construc‐
       tions  such as list items or block quotes.  Pandoc lifts this arbitrary seeming restriction.  So the following is fine in
       pandoc, though not in most other implementations:

              > My block [quote].
              >
              > [quote]: /foo

   Extension: shortcut_reference_links
       In a shortcut reference link, the second pair of brackets may be omitted entirely:

              See [my website].

              [my website]: http://foo.bar.baz

   Internal links
       To link to another section of the same document, use the automatically generated  identifier  (see  Header  identifiers).
       For example:

              See the [Introduction](#introduction).

       or

              See the [Introduction].

              [Introduction]: #introduction

       Internal links are currently supported for HTML formats (including HTML slide shows and EPUB), LaTeX, and ConTeXt.

   Images
       A link immediately preceded by a ! will be treated as an image.  The link text will be used as the image's alt text:

              ![la lune](lalune.jpg "Voyage to the moon")

              ![movie reel]

              [movie reel]: movie.gif

   Extension: implicit_figures
       An  image  with  nonempty alt text, occurring by itself in a paragraph, will be rendered as a figure with a caption.  The
       image's alt text will be used as the caption.

              ![This is the caption](/url/of/image.png)

       How this is rendered depends on the output format.  Some output formats (e.g.  RTF) do not yet support figures.  In those
       formats, you'll just get an image in a paragraph by itself, with no caption.

       If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the only thing in the paragraph.  One way to do this is
       to insert a nonbreaking space after the image:

              ![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\

       Note that in reveal.js slide shows, an image in a paragraph by itself that has the stretch class will  fill  the  screen,
       and the caption and figure tags will be omitted.

   Extension: link_attributes
       Attributes can be set on links and images:

              An inline ![image](foo.jpg){#id .class width=30 height=20px}
              and a reference ![image][ref] with attributes.

              [ref]: foo.jpg "optional title" {#id .class key=val key2="val 2"}

       (This syntax is compatible with PHP Markdown Extra when only #id and .class are used.)

       For HTML and EPUB, all attributes except width and height (but including srcset and sizes) are passed through as is.  The
       other writers ignore attributes that are not supported by their output format.

       The width and height attributes on images are treated specially.  When used without a unit, the unit  is  assumed  to  be
       pixels.   However,  any of the following unit identifiers can be used: px, cm, mm, in, inch and %.  There must not be any
       spaces between the number and the unit.  For example:

              ![](file.jpg){ width=50% }

       • Dimensions are converted to inches for output in page-based formats like LaTeX.  Dimensions are converted to pixels for
         output in HTML-like formats.  Use the --dpi option to specify the number of pixels per inch.  The default is 96dpi.

       • The % unit is generally relative to some available space.  For example the above example will render to the following.

         • HTML: <img href="file.jpg" style="width: 50%;" />

         • LaTeX:  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{file.jpg}  (If  you're  using a custom template, you
           need to configure graphicx as in the default template.)

         • ConTeXt: \externalfigure[file.jpg][width=0.5\textwidth]

       • Some output formats have a notion of a class (ConTeXt) or a unique identifier (LaTeX \caption), or both (HTML).

       • When no width or height attributes are specified, the fallback is to look at the image resolution and the dpi        metadata
         embedded in the image file.

   Divs and Spans
       Using  the native_divs and native_spans extensions (see above), HTML syntax can be used as part of markdown to create na‐
       tive Div and Span elements in the pandoc AST (as opposed to raw HTML).  However, there is also nicer syntax available:

   Extension: fenced_divs
       Allow special fenced syntax for native Div blocks.  A Div starts with a  fence  containing  at  least  three  consecutive
       colons plus some attributes.  The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons.  The at‐
       tribute syntax is exactly as in fenced code blocks (see Extension: fenced_code_attributes).  As with fenced code  blocks,
       one  can use either attributes in curly braces or a single unbraced word, which will be treated as a class name.  The Div
       ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons.  The fenced Div should be  separated  by
       blank lines from preceding and following blocks.

       Example:

              ::::: {#special .sidebar}
              Here is a paragraph.

              And another.
              :::::

       Fenced divs can be nested.  Opening fences are distinguished because they must have attributes:

              ::: Warning ::::::
              This is a warning.

              ::: Danger
              This is a warning within a warning.
              :::
              ::::::::::::::::::

       Fences without attributes are always closing fences.  Unlike with fenced code blocks, the number of colons in the closing
       fence need not match the number in the opening fence.  However, it can be helpful for visual clarity  to  use  fences  of
       different lengths to distinguish nested divs from their parents.

   Extension: bracketed_spans
       A  bracketed  sequence  of  inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will be treated as a Span with attributes if it is
       followed immediately by attributes:

              [This is *some text*]{.class key="val"}

   Footnotes
   Extension: footnotes
       Pandoc's Markdown allows footnotes, using the following syntax:

              Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

              [^1]: Here is the footnote.

              [^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

                  Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
              belong to the previous footnote.

                      { some.code }

                  The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
                  line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
                  multi-paragraph list items.

              This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
              isn't indented.

       The identifiers in footnote references may not contain spaces, tabs, or newlines.  These identifiers  are  used  only  to
       correlate the footnote reference with the note itself; in the output, footnotes will be numbered sequentially.

       The  footnotes  themselves  need  not be placed at the end of the document.  They may appear anywhere except inside other
       block elements (lists, block quotes, tables, etc.).  Each footnote should be separated from surrounding content  (includ‐
       ing other footnotes) by blank lines.

   Extension: inline_notes
       Inline footnotes are also allowed (though, unlike regular notes, they cannot contain multiple paragraphs).  The syntax is
       as follows:

              Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
              you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
              note.]

       Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.

   Citations
   Extension: citations
       Using an external filter, pandoc-citeproc, pandoc can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number  of
       styles.  Basic usage is

              pandoc --filter pandoc-citeproc myinput.txt

       In  order  to  use  this feature, you will need to specify a bibliography file using the bibliography metadata field in a
       YAML metadata section, or --bibliography command line argument.  You can supply multiple --bibliography arguments or  set
       bibliography metadata field to YAML array, if you want to use multiple bibliography files.  The bibliography may have any
       of these formats:

       Format        File extension
       ─────────────────────────────
       BibLaTeX      .bib
       BibTeX        .bibtex
       Copac         .copac
       CSL JSON      .json
       CSL YAML      .yaml
       EndNote       .enl
       EndNote XML   .xml
       ISI           .wos
       MEDLINE       .medline
       MODS          .mods
       RIS           .ris

       Note that .bib can be used with both BibTeX and BibLaTeX files; use .bibtex to force BibTeX.

       Note that pandoc-citeproc --bib2json and pandoc-citeproc --bib2yaml can produce .json and .yaml files  from  any  of  the
       supported formats.

       In-field  markup:  In  BibTeX  and BibLaTeX databases, pandoc-citeproc parses a subset of LaTeX markup; in CSL YAML data‐
       bases, pandoc Markdown; and in CSL JSON databases, an HTML-like markup:

       <i>...</i>
              italics

       <b>...</b>
              bold

       <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">...</span> or <sc>...</sc>
              small capitals

       <sub>...</sub>
              subscript

       <sup>...</sup>
              superscript

       <span class="nocase">...</span>
              prevent a phrase from being capitalized as title case

       pandoc-citeproc -j and -y interconvert the CSL JSON and CSL YAML formats as far as possible.

       As an alternative to specifying a bibliography file using --bibliography or the YAML metadata field bibliography, you can
       include  the citation data directly in the references field of the document's YAML metadata.  The field should contain an
       array of YAML-encoded references, for example:

              ---
              references:
              - type: article-journal
                id: WatsonCrick1953
                author:
                - family: Watson
                  given: J. D.
                - family: Crick
                  given: F. H. C.
                issued:
                  date-parts:
                  - - 1953
                    - 4
                    - 25
                title: 'Molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for deoxyribose
                  nucleic acid'
                title-short: Molecular structure of nucleic acids
                container-title: Nature
                volume: 171
                issue: 4356
                page: 737-738
                DOI: 10.1038/171737a0
                URL: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v171/n4356/abs/171737a0.html
                language: en-GB
              ...

       (pandoc-citeproc --bib2yaml can produce these from a bibliography file in one of the supported formats.)

       Citations and references can be formatted using any style supported by the Citation Style Language, listed in the  Zotero
       Style  Repository.   These  files  are  specified  using  the  --csl  option or the csl metadata field.  By default, pan‐
       doc-citeproc will use the Chicago Manual of Style author-date format.  The CSL project provides  further  information  on
       finding and editing styles.

       To  make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries, add link-citations: true to your YAML meta‐
       data.

       Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.  Each citation must have a key, composed  of  '@'  +
       the  citation  identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix.  The citation key
       must begin with a  letter,  digit,  or  _,  and  may  contain  alphanumerics,  _,  and  internal  punctuation  characters
       (:.#$%&-+?<>~/).  Here are some examples:

              Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].

              Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

              Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

       pandoc-citeproc  detects  locator terms in the CSL locale files.  Either abbreviated or unabbreviated forms are accepted.
       In the en-US locale, locator terms can be written in either  singular  or  plural  forms,  as  book,  bk./bks.;  chapter,
       chap./chaps.;  column,  col./cols.;  figure, fig./figs.; folio, fol./fols.; number, no./nos.; line, l./ll.; note, n./nn.;
       opus, op./opp.; page, p./pp.; paragraph, para./paras.; part, pt./pts.; section, sec./secs.; sub verbo, s.v./s.vv.; verse,
       v./vv.; volume, vol./vols.; ¶/¶¶; §/§§.    If no locator term is used, "page" is assumed.

       pandoc-citeproc will use heuristics to distinguish the locator from the suffix.  In complex cases, the locator can be en‐
       closed in curly braces (using pandoc-citeproc 0.15 and higher only):

              [@smith{ii, A, D-Z}, with a suffix]
              [@smith, {pp. iv, vi-xi, (xv)-(xvii)} with suffix here]

       A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation.  This can be useful when the author is
       already mentioned in the text:

              Smith says blah [-@smith04].

       You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

              @smith04 says blah.

              @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.

       If the style calls for a list of works cited, it will be placed in a div with id refs, if one exists:

              ::: #refs
              :::

       Otherwise,  it  will  be  placed at the end of the document.  Generation of the bibliography can be suppressed by setting
       suppress-bibliography: true in the YAML metadata.

       If you wish the bibliography to have a section header, you can set reference-section-title in the metadata,  or  put  the
       header at the beginning of the div with id refs (if you are using it) or at the end of your document:

              last paragraph...

              # References

       The  bibliography  will  be  inserted after this header.  Note that the unnumbered class will be added to this header, so
       that the section will not be numbered.

       If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can  define  a  dummy
       nocite metadata field and put the citations there:

              ---
              nocite: |
                @item1, @item2
              ...

              @item3

       In  this  example,  the  document  will  contain a citation for item3 only, but the bibliography will contain entries for
       item1, item2, and item3.

       It is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether or not they appear in the document,  by  using  a
       wildcard:

              ---
              nocite: |
                @*
              ...

       For  LaTeX output, you can also use natbib or biblatex to render the bibliography.  In order to do so, specify bibliogra‐
       phy files as outlined above, and add --natbib or --biblatex argument to pandoc invocation.  Bear in mind that  bibliogra‐
       phy files have to be in respective format (either BibTeX or BibLaTeX).

       For more information, see the pandoc-citeproc man page.

   Non-pandoc extensions
       The following Markdown syntax extensions are not enabled by default in pandoc, but may be enabled by adding +EXTENSION to
       the format name, where EXTENSION is the name of the extension.  Thus, for example, markdown+hard_line_breaks is  Markdown
       with hard line breaks.

   Extension: old_dashes
       Selects  the pandoc <= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart dashes: - before a numeral is an en-dash, and -- is an em-dash.
       This option only has an effect if smart is enabled.  It is selected automatically for textile input.

   Extension: angle_brackets_escapable
       Allow < and > to be backslash-escaped, as they can be in GitHub flavored Markdown but not original Markdown.  This is im‐
       plied by pandoc's default all_symbols_escapable.

   Extension: lists_without_preceding_blankline
       Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening blank space.

   Extension: four_space_rule
       Selects  the  pandoc  <= 2.0 behavior for parsing lists, so that four spaces indent are needed for list item continuation
       paragraphs.

   Extension: spaced_reference_links
       Allow whitespace between the two components of a reference link, for example,

              [foo] [bar].

   Extension: hard_line_breaks
       Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line breaks instead of spaces.

   Extension: ignore_line_breaks
       Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks.   This  op‐
       tion  is  intended  for  use  with East Asian languages where spaces are not used between words, but text is divided into
       lines for readability.

   Extension: east_asian_line_breaks
       Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks,  when  they
       occur  between  two East Asian wide characters.  This is a better choice than ignore_line_breaks for texts that include a
       mix of East Asian wide characters and other characters.

   Extension: emoji
       Parses textual emojis like :smile: as Unicode emoticons.

   Extension: tex_math_single_backslash
       Causes anything between \( and \) to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between \[ and \] to be  interpreted
       as display TeX math.  Note: a drawback of this extension is that it precludes escaping ( and [.

   Extension: tex_math_double_backslash
       Causes  anything  between \\( and \\) to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between \\[ and \\] to be inter‐
       preted as display TeX math.

   Extension: markdown_attribute
       By default, pandoc interprets material inside block-level tags as Markdown.  This extension changes the behavior so  that
       Markdown is only parsed inside block-level tags if the tags have the attribute markdown=1.

   Extension: mmd_title_block
       Enables a MultiMarkdown style title block at the top of the document, for example:

              Title:   My title
              Author:  John Doe
              Date:    September 1, 2008
              Comment: This is a sample mmd title block, with
                       a field spanning multiple lines.

       See  the  MultiMarkdown documentation for details.  If pandoc_title_block or yaml_metadata_block is enabled, it will take
       precedence over mmd_title_block.

   Extension: abbreviations
       Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like

              *[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language

       Note that the pandoc document model does not support abbreviations, so if this extension is  enabled,  abbreviation  keys
       are simply skipped (as opposed to being parsed as paragraphs).

   Extension: autolink_bare_uris
       Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by pointy braces <...>.

   Extension: mmd_link_attributes
       Parses multimarkdown style key-value attributes on link and image references.  This extension should not be confused with
       the link_attributes extension.

              This is a reference ![image][ref] with multimarkdown attributes.

              [ref]: http://path.to/image "Image title" width=20px height=30px
                     id=myId class="myClass1 myClass2"

   Extension: mmd_header_identifiers
       Parses multimarkdown style header identifiers (in square brackets, after the header but before any trailing #s in an  ATX
       header).

   Extension: compact_definition_lists
       Activates  the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier.  This syntax differs from the one described above un‐
       der Definition lists in several respects:

       • No blank line is required between consecutive items of the definition list.

       • To get a "tight" or "compact" list, omit space between consecutive items; the space between a term and  its  definition
         does not affect anything.

       • Lazy wrapping of paragraphs is not allowed: the entire definition must be indented four spaces.

   Markdown variants
       In addition to pandoc's extended Markdown, the following Markdown variants are supported:

       markdown_phpextra (PHP Markdown Extra)
              footnotes, pipe_tables, raw_html, markdown_attribute, fenced_code_blocks, definition_lists, intraword_underscores,
              header_attributes, link_attributes, abbreviations, shortcut_reference_links, spaced_reference_links.

       markdown_github (deprecated GitHub-Flavored Markdown)
              pipe_tables,  raw_html,  fenced_code_blocks,  auto_identifiers,  gfm_auto_identifiers,  backtick_code_blocks,  au‐
              tolink_bare_uris,  space_in_atx_header,  intraword_underscores,  strikeout,  emoji,  shortcut_reference_links, an‐
              gle_brackets_escapable, lists_without_preceding_blankline.

       markdown_mmd (MultiMarkdown)
              pipe_tables, raw_html, markdown_attribute, mmd_link_attributes, tex_math_double_backslash,  intraword_underscores,
              mmd_title_block, footnotes, definition_lists, all_symbols_escapable, implicit_header_references, auto_identifiers,
              mmd_header_identifiers, shortcut_reference_links, implicit_figures, superscript, subscript,  backtick_code_blocks,
              spaced_reference_links, raw_attribute.

       markdown_strict (Markdown.pl)
              raw_html, shortcut_reference_links, spaced_reference_links.

       We also support commonmark and gfm (GitHub-Flavored Markdown, which is implemented as a set of extensions on commonmark).

       Note,  however,  that  commonmark  and  gfm  have limited support for extensions.  Only those listed below (and smart and
       raw_tex) will work.  The extensions can, however, all be individually disabled.  Also, raw_tex only affects  gfm  output,
       not input.

       gfm (GitHub-Flavored Markdown)
              pipe_tables,  raw_html,  fenced_code_blocks,  auto_identifiers,  gfm_auto_identifiers,  backtick_code_blocks,  au‐
              tolink_bare_uris, space_in_atx_header,  intraword_underscores,  strikeout,  emoji,  shortcut_reference_links,  an‐

PRODUCING SLIDE SHOWS WITH PANDOC
       You  can  use  pandoc to produce an HTML + JavaScript slide presentation that can be viewed via a web browser.  There are
       five ways to do this, using S5, DZSlides, Slidy, Slideous, or reveal.js.  You can also produce a PDF slide show using La‐
       TeX beamer, or slides shows in Microsoft PowerPoint format.

       Here's the Markdown source for a simple slide show, habits.txt:

              % Habits
              % John Doe
              % March 22, 2005

              # In the morning

              ## Getting up

              - Turn off alarm
              - Get out of bed

              ## Breakfast

              - Eat eggs
              - Drink coffee

              # In the evening

              ## Dinner

              - Eat spaghetti
              - Drink wine

              ------------------

              ![picture of spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

              ## Going to sleep

              - Get in bed
              - Count sheep

       To produce an HTML/JavaScript slide show, simply type

              pandoc -t FORMAT -s habits.txt -o habits.html

       where FORMAT is either s5, slidy, slideous, dzslides, or revealjs.

       For  Slidy,  Slideous,  reveal.js,  and  S5, the file produced by pandoc with the -s/--standalone option embeds a link to
       JavaScript and CSS files, which are assumed to be available at the relative  path  s5/default  (for  S5),  slideous  (for
       Slideous), reveal.js (for reveal.js), or at the Slidy website at w3.org (for Slidy).  (These paths can be changed by set‐
       ting the slidy-url, slideous-url, revealjs-url, or s5-url variables; see Variables for slides, above.) For DZSlides,  the
       (relatively short) JavaScript and CSS are included in the file by default.

       With  all  HTML  slide formats, the --self-contained option can be used to produce a single file that contains all of the
       data necessary to display the slide show, including linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos.

       To produce a PDF slide show using beamer, type

              pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -o habits.pdf

       Note that a reveal.js slide show can also be converted to a PDF by printing it to a file from the browser.

       To produce a Powerpoint slide show, type

              pandoc habits.txt -o habits.pptx

   Structuring the slide show
       By default, the slide level is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not
       another header, somewhere in the document.  In the example above, level 1 headers are always followed by level 2 headers,
       which are followed by content, so 2 is the slide level.  This default can be overridden using the --slide-level option.

       The document is carved up into slides according to the following rules:

       • A horizontal rule always starts a new slide.

       • A header at the slide level always starts a new slide.

       • Headers below the slide level in the hierarchy create headers within a slide.

       • Headers above the slide level in the hierarchy create "title slides," which just contain the section title and help  to
         break the slide show into sections.

       • Content above the slide level will not appear in the slide show.

       • A  title  page  is constructed automatically from the document's title block, if present.  (In the case of beamer, this
         can be disabled by commenting out some lines in the default template.)

       These rules are designed to support many different styles of slide show.  If you don't care about structuring your slides
       into  sections  and subsections, you can just use level 1 headers for all each slide.  (In that case, level 1 will be the
       slide level.) But you can also structure the slide show into sections, as in the example above.

       Note: in reveal.js slide shows, if slide level is 2, a two-dimensional layout will be  produced,  with  level  1  headers
       building horizontally and level 2 headers building vertically.  It is not recommended that you use deeper nesting of sec‐
       tion levels with reveal.js.

   Incremental lists
       By default, these writers produce lists that display "all at once." If you want your lists to display incrementally  (one
       item at a time), use the -i option.  If you want a particular list to depart from the default, put it in a div block with
       class incremental or nonincremental.  So, for example, using the fenced div syntax, the following  would  be  incremental
       regardless of the document default:

              ::: incremental

              - Eat spaghetti
              - Drink wine

              :::

       or

              ::: nonincremental

              - Eat spaghetti
              - Drink wine

              :::

       While using incremental and nonincremental divs are the recommended method of setting incremental lists on a per-case ba‐
       sis, an older method is also supported: putting lists inside a blockquote will depart from the document default (that is,
       it will display incrementally without the -i option and all at once with the -i option):

              > - Eat spaghetti
              > - Drink wine

       Both methods allow incremental and nonincremental lists to be mixed in a single document.

   Inserting pauses
       You can add "pauses" within a slide by including a paragraph containing three dots, separated by spaces:

              # Slide with a pause

              content before the pause

              . . .

              content after the pause

   Styling the slides
       You  can  change the style of HTML slides by putting customized CSS files in $DATADIR/s5/default (for S5), $DATADIR/slidy
       (for Slidy), or $DATADIR/slideous (for Slideous), where $DATADIR is the user data directory (see --data-dir, above).  The
       originals  may  be  found in pandoc's system data directory (generally $CABALDIR/pandoc-VERSION/s5/default).  Pandoc will
       look there for any files it does not find in the user data directory.

       For dzslides, the CSS is included in the HTML file itself, and may be modified there.

       All reveal.js configuration options can be set through variables.  For example, themes can be used by setting  the  theme
       variable:

              -V theme=moon

       Or you can specify a custom stylesheet using the --css option.

       To style beamer slides, you can specify a theme, colortheme, fonttheme, innertheme, and outertheme, using the -V option:

              pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -V theme:Warsaw -o habits.pdf

       Note that header attributes will turn into slide attributes (on a <div> or <section>) in HTML slide formats, allowing you
       to style individual slides.  In beamer, the only header attribute that affects  slides  is  the  allowframebreaks  class,
       which  sets  the allowframebreaks option, causing multiple slides to be created if the content overfills the frame.  This
       is recommended especially for bibliographies:

              # References {.allowframebreaks}

   Speaker notes
       Speaker notes are supported in reveal.js and PowerPoint (pptx) output.  You can add notes to your Markdown document thus:

              ::: notes

              This is my note.

              - It can contain Markdown
              - like this list

              :::

       To show the notes window in reveal.js, press s while viewing the presentation.   Speaker  notes  in  PowerPoint  will  be
       available, as usual, in handouts and presenter view.

       Notes are not yet supported for other slide formats, but the notes will not appear on the slides themselves.

   Columns
       To  put  material  in side by side columns, you can use a native div container with class columns, containing two or more
       div containers with class column and a width attribute:

              :::::::::::::: {.columns}
              ::: {.column width="40%"}
              contents...
              :::
              ::: {.column width="60%"}
              contents...
              :::
              ::::::::::::::

   Frame attributes in beamer
       Sometimes it is necessary to add the LaTeX [fragile] option to a frame in beamer (for example, when using the minted  en‐
       vironment).  This can be forced by adding the fragile class to the header introducing the slide:

              # Fragile slide {.fragile}

       All  of  the  other  frame attributes described in Section 8.1 of the Beamer User's Guide may also be used: allowdisplay‐
       breaks, allowframebreaks, b, c, t, environment, label, plain, shrink, standout, noframenumbering.

   Background in reveal.js and beamer
       Background images can be added to self-contained reveal.js slideshows and to beamer slideshows.

       For the same image on every slide, use the configuration option background-image either in the YAML metadata block or  as
       a  command-line  variable.   (There  are  no  other  options  in  beamer  and the rest of this section concerns reveal.js
       slideshows.)

       For reveal.js, you can instead use the reveal.js-native option parallaxBackgroundImage.  You can also  set  parallaxBack‐
       groundHorizontal and parallaxBackgroundVertical the same way and must also set parallaxBackgroundSize to have your values
       take effect.

       To set an image for a particular reveal.js slide, add {data-background-image="/path/to/image"} to the  first  slide-level
       header on the slide (which may even be empty).

       In reveal.js's overview mode, the parallaxBackgroundImage will show up only on the first slide.

       Other  reveal.js  background settings also work on individual slides, including data-background-size, data-background-re‐
       peat, data-background-color, data-transition, and data-transition-speed.

       See the reveal.js documentation for more details.

       For example in reveal.js:

              ---
              title: My Slideshow
              parallaxBackgroundImage: /path/to/my/background_image.png
              ---

              ## Slide One

              Slide 1 has background_image.png as its background.

              ## {data-background-image="/path/to/special_image.jpg"}

              Slide 2 has a special image for its background, even though the header has no content.

CREATING EPUBS WITH PANDOC
   EPUB Metadata
       EPUB metadata may be specified using the --epub-metadata option, but if the source document is Markdown, it is better  to
       use a YAML metadata block.  Here is an example:

              ---
              title:
              - type: main
                text: My Book
              - type: subtitle
                text: An investigation of metadata
              creator:
              - role: author
                text: John Smith
              - role: editor
                text: Sarah Jones
              identifier:
              - scheme: DOI
                text: doi:10.234234.234/33

              ibooks:
                version: 1.3.4
              ...

       The following fields are recognized:

       identifier
              Either  a  string  value  or an object with fields text and scheme.  Valid values for scheme are ISBN-10, GTIN-13,

       creator
              Either  a string value, or an object with fields role, file-as, and text, or a list of such objects.  Valid values
              for role are MARC relators, but pandoc will attempt to translate the human-readable versions  (like  "author"  and
              "editor") to the appropriate marc relators.

       ibooks iBooks-specific metadata, with the following fields:

              • version: (string)

              • specified-fonts: true|false (default false)

              • ipad-orientation-lock: portrait-only|landscape-only

              • iphone-orientation-lock: portrait-only|landscape-only

              • binding: true|false (default true)

              • scroll-axis: vertical|horizontal|default

   The epub:type attribute
       For epub3 output, you can mark up the header that corresponds to an EPUB chapter using the epub:type attribute.  For  ex‐
       ample, to set the attribute to the value prologue, use this markdown:

              # My chapter {epub:type=prologue}

       Which will result in:

              <body epub:type="frontmatter">
                <section epub:type="prologue">
                  <h1>My chapter</h1>

       Pandoc will output <body epub:type="bodymatter">, unless you use one of the following values, in which case either front‐
       matter or backmatter will be output.

       epub:type of first section   epub:type of body

   Linked media
       By default, pandoc will download media referenced from any <img>, <audio>, <video> or <source>  element  present  in  the
       generated  EPUB, and include it in the EPUB container, yielding a completely self-contained EPUB.  If you want to link to
       external media resources instead, use raw HTML in your source and add data-external="1" to the tag with  the  src  attri‐
       bute.  For example:

              <audio controls="1">
                <source src="http://example.com/music/toccata.mp3"
                        data-external="1" type="audio/mpeg">
                </source>
              </audio>

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
       Pandoc  will  automatically highlight syntax in fenced code blocks that are marked with a language name.  The Haskell li‐
       brary skylighting is used for highlighting.  Currently highlighting is supported only for HTML, EPUB, Docx, Ms,  and  La‐
       TeX/PDF output.  To see a list of language names that pandoc will recognize, type pandoc --list-highlight-languages.

       The  color  scheme  can be selected using the --highlight-style option.  The default color scheme is pygments, which imi‐
       tates the default color scheme used by the Python library pygments (though pygments is not actually used to do the  high‐
       lighting).  To see a list of highlight styles, type pandoc --list-highlight-styles.

       If  you  are not satisfied with the predefined styles, you can use --print-highlight-style to generate a JSON .theme file
       which can be modified and used as the argument to --highlight-style.  To get a JSON version of the  pygments  style,  for
       example:

              pandoc --print-highlight-style pygments > my.theme

       Then edit my.theme and use it like this:

              pandoc --highlight-style my.theme

       If  you  are not satisfied with the built-in highlighting, or you want highlight a language that isn't supported, you can
       use the --syntax-definition option to load a KDE-style XML syntax definition file.  Before writing your own, have a  look
       at KDE's repository of syntax definitions.

       To disable highlighting, use the --no-highlight option.

CUSTOM STYLES IN DOCX
   Input
       The  docx  reader, by default, only reads those styles that it can convert into pandoc elements, either by direct conver‐
       sion or interpreting the derivation of the input document's styles.

       By enabling the styles extension in the docx reader (-f docx+styles), you can produce output that maintains the styles of
       the  input  document, using the custom-style class.  Paragraph styles are interpreted as divs, while character styles are
       interpreted as spans.

       For example, using the custom-style-reference.docx file in the test directory, we have the following different outputs:

       Without the +styles extension:

              $ pandoc test/docx/custom-style-reference.docx -f docx -t markdown
              This is some text.

              This is text with an *emphasized* text style. And this is text with a
              **strengthened** text style.

              > Here is a styled paragraph that inherits from Block Text.

       And with the extension:

              $ pandoc test/docx/custom-style-reference.docx -f docx+styles -t markdown

              ::: {custom-style="FirstParagraph"}
              This is some text.
              :::

              ::: {custom-style="BodyText"}
              This is text with an [emphasized]{custom-style="Emphatic"} text style.
              And this is text with a [strengthened]{custom-style="Strengthened"}
              text style.
              :::

              ::: {custom-style="MyBlockStyle"}
              > Here is a styled paragraph that inherits from Block Text.
              :::

       With these custom styles, you can use your input document as a reference-doc while creating docx output (see below),  and
       maintain the same styles in your input and output files.

   Output
       By  default,  pandoc's docx output applies a predefined set of styles for blocks such as paragraphs and block quotes, and
       uses largely default formatting (italics, bold) for inlines.  This will work for most purposes,  especially  alongside  a
       reference.docx file.  However, if you need to apply your own styles to blocks, or match a preexisting set of styles, pan‐
       doc allows you to define custom styles for blocks and text using divs and spans, respectively.

       If you define a div or span with the attribute custom-style, pandoc will apply your specified style to the contained ele‐
       ments.  So, for example using the bracketed_spans syntax,

              [Get out]{custom-style="Emphatically"}, he said.

       would produce a docx file with "Get out" styled with character style Emphatically.  Similarly, using the fenced_divs syn‐
       tax,

              Dickinson starts the poem simply:

              ::: {custom-style="Poetry"}
              | A Bird came down the Walk---
              | He did not know I saw---
              :::

       would style the two contained lines with the Poetry paragraph style.

       If the styles are not yet in your reference.docx, they will be defined in the output file as inheriting from normal text.
       If they are already defined, pandoc will not alter the definition.

       This  feature  allows  for  greatest  customization in conjunction with pandoc filters.  If you want all paragraphs after
       block quotes to be indented, you can write a filter to apply the styles necessary.  If you want all italics to be  trans‐
       formed  to  the Emphasis character style (perhaps to change their color), you can write a filter which will transform all
       italicized inlines to inlines within an Emphasis custom-style span.

CUSTOM WRITERS
       Pandoc can be extended with custom writers written in lua.  (Pandoc includes a lua interpreter, so lua need  not  be  in‐
       stalled separately.)

       To use a custom writer, simply specify the path to the lua script in place of the output format.  For example:

              pandoc -t data/sample.lua

       Creating  a custom writer requires writing a lua function for each possible element in a pandoc document.  To get a docu‐
       mented example which you can modify according to your needs, do

              pandoc --print-default-data-file sample.lua

A NOTE ON SECURITY
       If you use pandoc to convert user-contributed content in a web application, here are some things to keep in mind:

       1. Although pandoc itself will not create or modify any files other than those you explicitly ask it create (with the ex‐
          ception  of  temporary files used in producing PDFs), a filter or custom writer could in principle do anything on your
          file system.  Please audit filters and custom writers very carefully before using them.

       2. If your application uses pandoc as a Haskell library (rather than shelling out to the executable), it is  possible  to
          use  it in a mode that fully isolates pandoc from your file system, by running the pandoc operations in the PandocPure
          monad.  See the document Using the pandoc API for more details.

       3. Pandoc's parsers can exhibit pathological performance on some corner cases.  It is wise to put any  pandoc  operations
          under  a timeout, to avoid DOS attacks that exploit these issues.  If you are using the pandoc executable, you can add
          the command line options +RTS -M512M -RTS (for example) to limit the heap size to 512MB.

       4. The HTML generated by pandoc is not guaranteed to be safe.  If raw_html is enabled for the Markdown input,  users  can
          inject  arbitrary  HTML.  Even if raw_html is disabled, users can include dangerous content in attributes for headers,
          spans, and code blocks.  To be safe, you should run all the generated HTML through an HTML sanitizer.
