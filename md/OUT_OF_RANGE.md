## out_of_range

### **Name**

**out_of_range**(3) - \[TYPE:NUMERIC\] Whether a numeric value can be
converted safely to another type

### **Synopsis**
```fortran
    result = out_of_range (x, mold [, round])
```
```fortran
     elemental logical function(x, mold, round)

      type(TYPE(kind=**)),intent(in) :: x
      type(TYPE(kind=**)),intent(in) :: mold
      logical,intent(in),optional    :: round
```
### **Characteristics**

 - **x** is of type _integer_ or _real_.
 - **mold** is an _integer_ or _real_ scalar.
 - **round** is a _logical_ scalar.
 - the result is a default _logical_.

### **Description**

   **out_of_range**(3) determines whether a value **x** can be converted
   safely to a _real_ or _integer_ variable the same type and kind
   as **mold**.

   For example, if **int8** is the __kind__ name for an 8-bit binary integer type,
   then for
```fortran
    logical :: L1, L2
    L1=out_of_range(-128.5, 0_int8)
    L2=out_of_range(-128.5, 0_int8,.true.)
    end
```
    L1 likely will have the value __.false.__ because the value will
    be truncated to -128.0, which is a representable integer number on a two's
    complement machine.

    L2 will be __.true.__ because it will be rounded to -129.0, which is not
    likely to be a representable eight-bit integer.

### **Options**
   - **x**
     : a scalar to be tested for whether it can be stored in a variable
     of the type and kind of **mold**

   - **mold**
     : the type and kind of the variable (but not the value) is used to
     identify the characteristics of the variable type to fit **x** into.

   - **round**
     : flag whether to round the value of **x** before validating it as
     a value like **mold**.

     **round** can only be present if **x** is of type
     _real_ and **mold** is of type _integer_.

### **Result**

From the standard:

   Case (i):     If **mold** is of type integer, and **round** is absent or
                 present with the value false, the result is true
                 if and only if the value of X is an IEEE infinity or
                 NaN, or if the integer with largest magnitude that lies
                 between zero and X inclusive is not representable by
                 objects with the type and kind of **mold**.

   Case (ii):    If **mold** is of type integer, and **round** is present with
                 the value true, the result is true if and only
                 if the value of X is an IEEE infinity or NaN, or
                 if the integer nearest X, or the integer of greater
                 magnitude if two integers are equally near to X, is not
                 representable by objects with the type and kind of **mold**.

   Case (iii):   Otherwise, the result is true if and only if the value
                 of X is an IEEE infinity or NaN that is not
                 supported by objects of the type and kind of **mold**,
                 or if X is a finite number and the result of rounding
                 the value of X (according to the IEEE rounding mode if
                 appropriate) to the extended model for the kind of **mold**
                 has magnitude larger than that of the largest finite
                 number with the same sign as X that is representable
                 by objects with the type and kind of **mold**.

   NOTE

   **mold** is required to be a scalar because the only information
   taken from it is its type and kind. Allowing an array **mold** would
   require that it be conformable with **x**. **round** is scalar because
   allowing an array rounding mode would have severe performance
   difficulties on many processors.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_out_of_range
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : int8, int16, int32, int64
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : real32, real64, real128
implicit none
integer            :: i
integer(kind=int8) :: i8, j8

    ! compilers are not required to produce an error on out of range.
    ! here storing the default integers into 1-byte integers
    ! incorrectly can have unexpected results
    do i=127,130
       i8=i
       j8=-i
       ! OUT_OF_RANGE(3f) can let you check if the value will fit
       write(*,*)i8,j8,' might have expected',i,-i, &
        & out_of_range( i,i8), &
        & out_of_range(-i,i8)
    enddo
    write(*,*) 'RANGE IS ',-1-huge(0_int8),'TO',huge(0_int8)
    ! the real -128.5 is truncated to -128 and is in range
    write(*,*) out_of_range (  -128.5, 0_int8)         ! false

    ! the real -128.5 is rounded to -129 and is not in range
    write(*,*) out_of_range (  -128.5, 0_int8, .true.) ! true

end program demo_out_of_range
```
Results:
```text
  >  127 -127  might have expected         127        -127 F F
  > -128 -128  might have expected         128        -128 T F
  > -127  127  might have expected         129        -129 T T
  > -126  126  might have expected         130        -130 T T
  > RANGE IS         -128 TO  127
  > F
  > T
```
